1. Read audio file - in the beginning one piano note.
2. Calculate a power spectrum of a given data using hamming window (Discrete Fourier Transform)
    a) Hamming window to filter important data from these which have value close to 0
        - as an argument hamming window takes length of a signal
        - not sure if hamming is going to be implemented.
    b) Calculate absolute value of transformed data to get rid of complex numbers
    c) Reduce the signal by chosen ratio to focus on first few harmonics.
3. Find Onsets in the signal:
    a) Calculating the difference between
