# Engineering Thesis: Monophonic instrument transcriber

## Overview
Project was carried out as my engineering thesis. The aim of this work was to propose a technique that transforms the acoustic signals of musical instruments into sheet music. To confirm the corectness of the approach and enable verification of the used technique I created a music application which performs such a transformation. 
The project focused on the analysis of monophonic instrumental soundtracks. Two instruments were analyzed, piano and saxophone.

As a result, application generates a file in pdf format containing the score of the processed audio track. It is also possible to save the obtained results to midi file.
